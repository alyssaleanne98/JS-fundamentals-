// Github is not the same as git 
// Git: provides us with local repositories stored in the cloud
// Github: provides us with remote repositories stored in the cloud 

// local repository is "linked" to a remote repo by adding "remote" with this command $ git remote add <name of remote> <URL of repo on GitHub>
